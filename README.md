# DCGAN in Keras(tf api) --MNIST

## Trained by google colab

#### the generator and discriminator models' weight has been saved in "models_and_weights" files

#### mnist dataset is in "MNIST_data" file if you want to download

### configuration

```shell
python 3.6
tensorflow 1.12+ (keras api)

numpy
```



## train our model

```shell
python dcgan_train.py
```



## train model on colab

```shell
using colab and the dcgan.ipynb file
```



## test our model

~~~ shell
